%In between words in a text, \TeX\ inserts space. This space has a
%natural component, plus stretch and shrink to make justified
%(right-aligned) text possible. Now, in certain styles of typesetting,
%there is more space after punctuation. This chapter discusses the
%mechanism that \TeX\ uses to realize such effect.
In between words in a text, \TeX\ inserts space. This space has a
natural component, plus stretch and shrink to make justified
(right-aligned) text possible. Now, in certain styles of typesetting,
there is more space after punctuation. This chapter discusses the
mechanism that \TeX\ uses to realize such effect.

%Here is the general idea:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item After every character token, the \cs{spacefactor} quantity is
%  updated with the space factor code of that character.
%\item When space is inserted, its natural size can be augmented
%  (if \cs{spacefactor}${}\geq2000$), and in general its stretch is
%  multiplied, and its shrink divided, by \cs{spacefactor}${}/1000$.
%\item There are further rules, for instance so that in \n{...word.)
%  And...} the space is modified according to the period, not the
%  closing parenthesis.
%\end{itemize}

%For every space token in horizontal mode the interword glue
%of the current font
%is inserted, with stretch and shrink components, all
%determined by \cs{fontdimen} parameters.
%To be specific, font dimension~2 is the normal interword space,
%dimension~3 is the amount of stretch of the interword
%space, and 4~is the amount of shrink. Font dimension
%7 is called the `extra space'; see below (the list
%of all the font dimensions appears on page~\pageref{font:dims}).

%Ordinarily all spaces between words (in one font) would be treated the

%When a character is added to the current horizontal list,

%There are two exceptions to this rule:

%\item When the space factor code of the last character is ${>}1000$
%  and the current space factor is ${<}1000$, the space factor
%  becomes~1000. This mechanism prevents elongated spaces after

\subsection{Other influences on the space factor}

%The space factor is 1000 when \TeX\ starts forming a
%horizontal list, in particular after \cs{indent}, \cs{noindent},
%and directly after a display. It is also 1000 after
%a \cs{vrule}, an accent, or a \gr{box} (in horizontal mode), but
%it is not influenced by \cs{unhbox} or \cs{unhcopy}
%commands.

%In the first column of a \cs{valign} the space factor of
